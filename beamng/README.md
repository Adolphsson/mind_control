## BEAM NG GVS Connector

This is the BEAMNG python code I used in the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YE05W1Eany4)

In order to use it, you will need to enable the UDP server inside BEAMNG.Drive and match the port number with what is in the code.

You will also need a GVS device as described in my [build video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj6u--lfeGo)

I know the code is quick and dirty and probably has several bugs.  Someday, I may revisit it.
